I've long embraced the flexibility and excellence of **remote-first distributed teams** (since 2010, not just 2020), but I prefer to live in the **mesaverse**‚Äîa world grounded in real experiences. Whether I'm exploring nature and cities by foot, bike, or canoe, capturing photographs, throwing frisbees, or building treehouses, I embrace experiences that spark creativity and deepen my connection to the world around me. I thrive in **hands-on, in-person collaboration**‚Äîwhether solving problems, building things, or simply sharing ideas face-to-face.

## my work

**As a software engineer** with extensive experience in **product strategy and design**, I help organizations navigate complex challenges by applying **user-centered design, rapid prototyping, and iterative development** to craft **smart, effective solutions that drive meaningful impact**. Whether tackling **digital health, security, or broader software challenges**, my focus remains on **solving complex problems efficiently and effectively**.  

At [**Medic**](https://medic.org), I led the **Product team** responsible for developing the [**Community Health Toolkit**](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org)‚Äîan open-source framework enabling healthcare innovation in some of the world's hardest-to-reach communities. This experience shaped my approach to **building teams, designing solutions, and ensuring technology is effective where it matters most**‚Äîin the environments and communities it‚Äôs built to serve.

I believe that **the best solutions emerge from a deep understanding of the problem and an iterative design process**‚Äîallowing ideas to evolve through thoughtful experimentation, refinement, and real-world use. By continuously learning and adapting, I focus on delivering **smart, actionable solutions that empower teams to build better products**.

If you‚Äôre interested in discussing ideas, collaborating, or just exchanging thoughts on software, design, or digital health, **please feel free to [reach out](contact)**!
